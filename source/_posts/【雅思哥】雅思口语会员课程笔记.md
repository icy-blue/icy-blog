这是雅思哥的会员系统课，报了正课之后送了 7 天会员，一些笔记分享一下~

## Part1 如何获得考官好感

- 自如、准确
- 不要踩中考官的雷区
  - 背答案万能模板->说不到点上或用词汇不正确（比如 claim 一般来说对其观点表示反对）
  - 没有拓展答案的意识（比如问 Where are you from 不要回答一个特别简单的答案）
  - 不要弄得太长，因为考官要在 4 分半问完 12 个问题
- 答案有真实感
  - 敢于否定（如果真没有相关的经历，就可以否定，说想象或者未来会不会怎么样）
    - To be honest, not really. I only read the books that our teachers requires us to read. In my spare time, I prefer playing computer games to reading.
    - To be honest, I never planted a tree because my schools never organized tree-planting activities. But in the future, I hope I can have a chance to participate in such meaningful activities.
  - 结合个人经历与感受
    - Do you often visit a museum? Actually, whenever I move to a new city, I only visit the museum there for once. I feel like the exhibits in museums are always the same. There’s no reason to visit twice.
    - Do you enjoy your current stage of life? I can’t say I totally enjoy my current stage of life. Even though my current life is quite comfortable, I don’t feel like there’s much personal growth. That’s why I’m thinking to study overseas and experience something new.
  - 敢于承认无知
    - What kind of trees do people usually plant in your country? Well, it’s really difficult for me to generate what kind of trees Chinese people usually plant. But I guess ... farmers like to plant fruit trees so they can make profits form selling fruits.
    - Do you know any famous people in your area? I personally don’t know anyone who I’d consider a famous person. And I guess there’s little possibility that those rich celebrities could live in my area.
